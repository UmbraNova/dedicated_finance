# Collaborative Group Organizer

<sup>note*</sup>
```
// DB = database
// LS = localstorage
```

**Welcome to Collaborative Group Organizer**, a non-native mobile app built using *JavaScript*, *CSS*, and *HTML*. This app leverages Firebase Realtime Database to provide seamless, real-time collaboration for creating and managing shared lists within groups. Whether it's organizing a shopping list, planning for an event, or managing tasks, this app allows multiple users to collaborate in real-time.

<sup>note*</sup>
<sub>*Remember! This is a personal project for learning purposes, maybe some refactoring is necessary. Also, idk why but this is my favorite function*</sub>

```javascript
function changeBgColorAndBack(elem, color1, color2) {
    elem.style.backgroundColor = color1
    setTimeout(function() {
        elem.style.backgroundColor = color2
    }, 150)
}
```


### Features:

* Realtime Updates: Experience the power of Firebase Realtime Database for instant updates. Every change made within the group is instantly reflected across all devices.

* User-friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive interface for adding, removing, and marking items as done. Anyone in the group can see the changes as they happen.

* Customizable Colors: Personalize items in your group by assigning different colors. Easily distinguish tasks or items assigned to different people. The changes are synchronized with everyone in the group.

* Dynamic Color Palette: Tailor the app to your preferences by customizing the color palette, background color, and main colors.

* Multi-user Collaboration: Invite others to your group by sharing the group name and password. Collaborate in real-time on tasks, events, or shopping lists.

### How to Use:
Create or Join Groups: Start by creating your own group or join an existing one by entering the group name and password.

* Add Items: Begin adding items to the group list, whether they are to-dos, shopping items, or tasks. Everyone in the group can see and interact with the items.

* Customize Colors: Personalize the group by assigning specific colors to items. This helps in easily identifying who is responsible for a particular task or item. All changes are synchronized across all devices.

* Change Color Palette: Customize the overall look of the app by changing the color palette, background color, and main colors. 

* Collaborate with Others: Share the group name and password with others to collaborate on group activities. Everyone can contribute and see real-time updates.
